# How-to-use-LIV-on-Oculus-Quest-with-ALVR
Install ALVR from Github onto your quest
portfoward  the port 9944 and 9943 for the server
and use your oculus quest IP as the Internal port

open up ALVR on your quest after side-loading ALPHA 5
there is a fix for the controllers on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/cjdhan/a_fork_of_alvr_has_been_done_by_someone_fixing/ this fixes some issues
for alpha 5 I reccomend changing the name of this APK to what it is on the actual GITHUB of ALVR after downloading it.

You also need to install ADB platform tools on your computer and enable developer mode on your phone, by pairing it in the Oculus app
and clicking more settings

Install ALVR setup, open ALVR,on your Quest, click the trigger button after connecting it on ALVR on your PC

If successful STEAM VR should start up and H C C should be green, now Open LIV before opening STEAM VR
so it recognizes it, and do the whole camera calibration thing and after saving it, launch any game in VR
and it should work

if not then IDK
